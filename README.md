## FeaturesOperational dashboard for the Tree Permit Lead Discovery System. DisplaysOperational dashboard for the Tree Permit Lead Discovery System. Displays permit leads sourced from Miami-Dade DERM, Fort Lauderdale, and City of Miami via an automated daily pipeline.



- **Lead Table** — sortable, filterable grid with global search (AG Grid)tree-related building permit leads sourced from Miami-Dade DERM, Fort Lauderdale,

- **Approve / Reject / Export** — single or bulk actions, synced to Supabase in real time

- **Overview Charts** — daily trend, source breakdown, score distributionand City of Miami via an automated pipeline that runs every 15 minutes.## Features

- **Map View** — geocoded leads on an interactive Leaflet map

- **System Health** — pipeline run history, source status, error tracking

- **Hot Leads** — top 10 highest-scored leads at a glance

- **Historical Data** — browse leads older than 90 days---- **Lead table** — AG Grid with sort, filter, pagination, and global search

- **Email Subscriptions** — opt in to daily digest directly from the dashboard

- **Dark Mode** — one-click toggle, persisted across sessions- **Approve / Reject / Export** — single-row and bulk actions synced to Supabase

- **Authentication** — write actions are password-protected

## Features- **Overview charts** — daily timeline, source breakdown, score distribution

## Authentication

Write actions (approve, reject, export, email settings) require login.
The auth endpoint is hosted on a Cloudflare Worker. Credentials are stored
as Cloudflare Worker secrets (`DASHBOARD_USERNAME`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`).
